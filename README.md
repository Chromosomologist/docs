# The Eludris Docs

The place where the docs of everything Eludris related exists.

We use [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to help facilitate the process
of making these documentations.

and than create a pr.

You will need [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to locally build the
documentation, also refer to the [mdBook documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
